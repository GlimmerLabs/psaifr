Okay, as I think about new directions.

1. A simple book on problem solving and non-representational computer
   art.  [Explain domain, demonstrate simple examples, etc.)  Add
   challenges: Make a black square in the middle of the page.

   a. Basics (the model, etc.)

   b. Adding color

   c. Adding time (n)

   d. Transforming images (add r, g, and b which are "the current color")

2. We need a "sign" function that takes negative numbers to -1, positive
   numbers to 1, and zero to zero.
